# AlternativeEnergy
Where are the best locations to build wind farms? 

## Procedure for running:
-  First, be sure that the individual station files appear within a folder called AlternativeEnergy/data/rawdata/weatherstations.  They need to be manually placed there because even zipped up, they would exceed Github's size limit.
-  For the purpose of this demonstration, a subset of weatherstation data files has been saved into this directory.
-  Run these notebooks under notebooks/final in the following order:
    -  data_cleanup.ipynb
    -  

-  Also available is a dataflow.png diagram located in AlternativeEnergy/data.
